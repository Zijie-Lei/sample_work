    <p><b>Q: What does EPPIC stand for?</b></p>
    <p>Evolutionary Protein-Protein Interface Classifier.</p>
    <p><b>Q: What can I use EPPIC for?</b></p>
    <p>
        EPPIC mainly aims at predicting the likely quaternary structure of protein crystals. It bases the predictions on
        evolutionary scoring of the pairwise interfaces present in the crystal. In addition to that it provides information
        of general use for a number of structural biology applications:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Precomputed Multiple Sequence Alignments (MSAs) of closely related homologs (within 60% sequence identity) for
            every protein in the PDB or for user-uploaded structures
        </li>
        <li>
            Colored-by-sequence-entropy surface representation in browser embedded NGL viewer. Very useful for looking at
            features present at protein surfaces: interfaces, binding sites etc.
        </li>
        <li>Number and distribution of core residues in interfaces</li>
        <li>
            Symmetry features of interfaces: the crystallographic operators generating each interface are provided and
            are depicted in red if they are conducive to infinite assemblies. Also, one can compare the left- and
            right-hand side of the Details table of each interface to see if it is isologous or heterologous
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Q: Is it open-source? Is it published open-access?</b></p>
    <p>
        EPPIC is being developed as a fully open-source tool in the frame of the SNF-funded, use-inspired project "Molecular
        evolution for structural biology: analyzing and predicting protein-protein interactions". Since 2012 we have been
        following an open-access policy with regard to publications related to this project (see Publications page).
    </p>
    <p><b>Q: How should I cite EPPIC?</b></p>
    <p>
        The main paper describing the EPPIC method is Bliven S, Lafita A, Parker A, Capitani G, Duarte JM, PLoS Computational
        Biology 2018. As well as citing the paper it is important that one cites the EPPIC software version (top right
        below the logo in results page) and even more important the UniProt database version (monthly releases) used for
        the evolutionary analysis. Our predictions depend on the sequence homologs found by searching the UniProt database
        so with every release of the database the predictions can change. UniProt is growing very fast these days so a
        few months of UniProt releases between two runs can make a difference.
    </p>
    <p><b>Q: How do I know if a prediction is reliable? Does EPPIC produce confidence values?</b></p>
    <p>
        EPPIC produces estimation of confidences both for assemblies and for interfaces. There are 3 levels of prediction confidence: high confidence, depicted with a golden star  ‚≠ê;
        medium confidence, depicted with a gray star  ; low confidence, depicted with no star.

        As well as the confidence values, there are a few useful indicators to understand if the prediction can be trusted or not:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The more sequence homologs the better: look at the number of homologs on the Sequence Information panel on
            top. If it is below 10 we will not even produce the evolutionary scores and the prediction will be purely
            geometrical (less reliable). If it is above 10 but not much larger than that one should be careful with the
            results.
        </li>
        <li>
            The sequence homologs should span a wide range of identities: look at their distribution by clicking on the
            icon next to the number of homologs. A typical case is that of some microbial proteins where only very close
            sequence homologs exist (>90%) and then nothing else is found in sequence databases until <40% identity.
            The resulting alignment will contain less information, thus the prediction will be less reliable.
        </li>
        <li>
            The stronger the consensus the better: if the three indicators are unanimous in their calls the prediction
            can be considered more reliable.
        </li>
        <li>
            Non full-length proteins (domains or fragments) are less reliably predicted: you can find out whether your
            protein is full-length or not by clicking on the  icon next to the chain name in the Sequence Information panel.
        </li>
        <li>
            Check for any kind of warnings: low resolution or R-free warnings on top and various per-interface warnings
            in the last column of the Main Interface table. This latter category encompasses engineering artifacts
            (mutations, expression tags), possible artifactual mediating ions, engineered disulfide bridges etc.
            If any of these warnings appear one should always treat the results with more care.
        </li>
    </ul>

        Usage
    </h1>
    <p><b>Q: What are the advanced input parameters for?</b></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Identity soft cut-off: The soft sequence identity cut-off for BLAST hits to be used in the alignment.
            If there are not enough sequences at this cut-off then the threshold is relaxed until the hard cut-off is reached.
        </li>
        <li>
            Identity hard cut-off: The hard sequence identity cut-off for BLAST hits to be used in the alignment.
            If there are not enough sequences at soft cut-off then the threshold is relaxed until this hard cut-off.
        </li>
        <li>
            Max num of sequences: The maximum number of sequences to be taken from the BLAST hits.
        </li>
        <li>
            Search Mode: The PDB sequence is first matched to its UniProt entry and that sequence is then used for blasting.
            In Global mode the full length UniProt is used, in local only the matching PDB part of the UniProt sequence is used.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p><b>Q: Do I need to change the input parameters?</b></p>
    <p>
        We don't recommend that the users change these parameters. We have used as default values the optimal ones found
        by benchmarking the method on validated datasets of biological interfaces and crystal contacts. Our precomputed
        results for PDB entries use always these defaults. A possible scenario where one would want to try other parameters
        is in the case of lack of sequence data within the default identity cut-offs. Predictions based on MSAs of too
        few sequences (<10 as a rule of thumb) are not reliable. Lowering the identity cut-off will find more sequences,
        but can at the same time introduce problems in the alignment and potentially affect the accuracy of predictions
        (see this figure)
    </p>
    <p><b>Q: When submitting my own PDB/mmCIF file, can I later access the results for the job? How about data privacy?</b></p>
    <p>
        Every new job run on the server is assigned a unique job identifier, a long alphanumeric string that is only
        known by the user and that is extremely hard to guess, thus safeguarding data privacy. The jobs and input data
        are stored on our servers for 1 month and then deleted. It is recommended that you give an email address while
        submitting so that you receive the URL with the job identifier in your inbox. Otherwise, you will have to
        bookmark it or keep a record of it yourself. It is always possible to retrieve the job by using the URL
        http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/#id/my_job_id . Whether the job is still running or already done, the URL will
        show its current status and automatically display the final results whenever it is finished. You can even share
        the URL with colleagues.
    </p>
    <p><b>Q: Can I directly link to the precomputed results for a PDB entry?</b></p>
    <p>
        The PDB-wide precomputed results can be accessed directly by using the permanent URLs: http://www.eppic-web.org/ewui/#id/PDB_code
    </p>
    <p><b>Q: What does the UniProt version on the home page indicate?</b></p>
    <p>
        The UniProt version (e.g. 2013_11) on the homepage denotes the UniProt version used to calculate the results of EPPIC.
        UniProt is used to blast for homologs of the input structure, which are then used to calculate entropy scores.
        These homologs can also slightly change from one version of UniProt to the next (monthly releases), so the
        results can vary over time. The UniProt version used for a calculation is also provided in the header of the
        Sequence Information panel in the results page.
    </p>
    <p><b>Q: What does the version below the EPPIC logo in results page indicate?</b></p>
    <p>
        We always keep improving EPPIC with bug-fixes and new features. The number displayed below the logo indicates
        the version of EPPIC used to calculate the results. To find out what has changed in various versions, please refer to our Release Log page.
    </p>
    <p><b>Q: Where can I get the sequence entropy information?</b></p>
    <p>
        A surface representation of each chain color coded by sequence entropy can be obtained by pressing "p" in the
        NGL 3D view window. The actual entropy values can be found in the Residue Detail tables (opened when clicking
        on the Details button in the Main Interface table).
